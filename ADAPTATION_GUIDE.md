## 3. Target Project Structure

## 3. Target Project Structure

To ensure a clean and scalable project structure, we will organize the adapted components as follows:

```
src/
|-- components/
|   |-- common/
|   |   |-- Button.astro
|   |   |-- Card.astro
|   |   |-- Logo.astro
|   |   `-- ... (other common UI elements)
|   |-- sections/
|   |   |-- Hero.astro
|   |   |-- AboutSummary.astro
|   |   |-- StudyPrograms.astro
|   |   |-- NewsSection.astro
|   |   |-- GallerySection.astro
|   |   |-- FaqSection.astro
|   |   `-- ... (other homepage sections)
|   `-- layout/
|       |-- Header.astro
|       |-- Footer.astro
|       `-- MainLayout.astro
|-- pages/
|   |-- index.astro
|   |-- tentang-kami.astro
|   |-- program-studi/
|   |   |-- akuntansi.astro
|   |   `-- manajemen.astro
|   |-- berita/
|   |   |-- [slug].astro
|   |   `-- index.astro
|   `-- ... (other pages)
`-- ... (other directories)
```

**Explanation:**

- **`src/components/common/`**: For reusable, generic components like buttons, cards, and other UI elements that can be used across the entire website.
- **`src/components/sections/`**: For larger, more specific components that make up the different sections of a page (e.g., the Hero section, the About section).
- **`src/components/layout/`**: For components that define the overall layout of the site, such as the header, footer, and main layout.
- **`src/pages/`**: For the actual pages of the website, which will be composed of the components from the `components` directory.

## 4. Implementation Approach

## 4. Implementation Approach

We will use the following approach to adapt the components:

- **Astro Components:** All components will be rebuilt as Astro components (`.astro` files). This will allow us to leverage Astro's server-side rendering capabilities for optimal performance.
- **Tailwind CSS:** We will use Tailwind CSS for styling, which is already set up in the STIE Dwimulya project. We will adapt the existing class names from the Aero components to match the Tailwind CSS conventions.
- **Client-Side JavaScript:** For interactive elements, such as the hero slider and FAQ accordion, we will use standard JavaScript (`<script>` tags within Astro components). We will extract the necessary logic from the original React components and adapt it to work in a non-React environment. We will avoid using React or other large frameworks to keep the client-side footprint as small as possible.
- **Data:** Component data, such as the content for slides, blog posts, and FAQ items, will be managed in separate TypeScript files (e.g., `src/data/homepage.ts`). This will keep the data separate from the component's presentation logic, making it easier to update content in the future.
